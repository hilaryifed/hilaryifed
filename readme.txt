What is the Guess the number game?

Guess the number is a very popular game in which one must guess a random number in a given time. For this game, the random number is between 1 and 200 and you are given 30 seconds to guess the correct number. To help the user, they'll be given 4 attempts to guess the correct number and the games allows you to keep playing as many times as you want even if you're unsuccesful on the fourth attempt. The programme first generates a random number between 1 and 200 and then it allows the user to input a guess up to 4 times and if you win it prints well done but if you lose it prints game over and the random number.

Rules
1) You have to guess a number between 1 and 200
